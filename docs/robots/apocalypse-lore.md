## The Nine Shells (Top to Bottom)

| Shell | Name | Description | Sin Theme |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------|
| 9 | Upper Spires | Wealthy elite, airship ports | Pride & Greed |
| 8 | Merchant Quarters | Trade & middle class | Gluttony & Envy |

## Design Inspirations

- **Final Fantasy 6**: Magic vs Technology, Opera House drama, World of Ruin
- **Final Fantasy 7**: Class warfare (Shinra/Avalanche), environmental themes, ancient evil
- **The Aeronaut's Windlass**: Spire cities, airship combat, talking cats, etherealist magic
- **Septerra Core**: Multi-shell world structure, ancient technology
- **Dante's Inferno**: Nine layers representing sin and descent

## Key Story Beats

1. **Start**: Hero begins in middle shells (5-7), unaware of full truth
2. **Rising Tension**: Mist rises, Core pulses, society fractures
3. **The Descent**: Hero must travel down through all shells
4. **Truth Revealed**: Discover the real apocalypse in The Deep
5. **Choice**: Save the shells or let them fall for a new beginning
6. **Confrontation**: Face what lies at The Core

## Gameplay Mechanics

- **Vertical World**: Travel between shells via airships, lifts, or dangerous climbing
- **Shell-Locked Content**: Certain items, enemies, and tech only appear in specific shells
- **Reputation System**: Actions in each shell affect your standing
- **Mist Surges**: Dynamic events where Mist pushes upward
- **Archaeological Discovery**: Piece together the old world's history
- **Multiple Endings**: Based on choices across all nine shells

## DLC Opportunities

- **Prequel**: The last days of the old world
- **Shell Side Stories**: Focus on individual shells and their cultures
- **The Deep Expeditions**: Extended dungeons in the old world ruins
- **Post-Game**: What happens after the Core is saved/destroyed
- **Legendary Creatures**: Ancient beings from before the apocalypse
