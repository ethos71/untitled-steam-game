# World Backstory: The Forgotten Apocalypse

## The Lost Age
Millions of years ago, our world—the world of concrete, technology, and modern civilization—faced total annihilation. The exact cause is lost to time: nuclear war, environmental collapse, dimensional rifts, or something far worse. All that remains are whispers in ancient texts and corrupted data fragments.

## The Mist
The apocalypse unleashed **The Mist**—a roiling, toxic fog filled with nightmarish creatures. These monsters are either:
- Mutated survivors of the old world
- Dimensional entities that breached through during the cataclysm
- The planet's immune response to humanity's sins

The Mist consumed the surface, making it uninhabitable. Only the strongest, most twisted beings survive below.

## The Shells: Dante's Inferno Reimagined

Humanity's last act was to build **The Shells**—massive layered structures reaching toward the sky, each one a world unto itself. Like Septerra Core's shell system, but vertical. Like Dante's Inferno, each layer represents a different level of sin, suffering, or salvation.

### Shell Structure (Surface to Core):

**Shell 9 - The Upper Spires (Paradise)**
- Where the wealthy and powerful reside
- Advanced airship technology, ethereal gardens
- Ignorant or willful blind to the suffering below
- *Sin: Pride & Greed*

**Shell 8 - The Merchant Quarters (Prosperity)**
- Trade hubs, artisan districts
- Middle class comfort, but growing unease
- *Sin: Gluttony & Envy*

**Shell 7 - The Industrial Layer (Labor)**
- Factories, crystal refineries
- Working class toil to keep upper shells running
- *Sin: Sloth (forced servitude)*

**Shell 6 - The Military Zone (Wrath)**
- Garrison shells protecting upper layers
- Constant drilling, war preparation
- Veterans who've seen the horrors below
- *Sin: Wrath*

**Shell 5 - The Undercity (Desperation)**
- Slums, black markets, forgotten souls
- Where people fall when they can't pay
- *Sin: Lust & Despair*

**Shell 4 - The Prison Mines (Punishment)**
- Forced labor extracting resources
- Political prisoners, criminals, debtors
- *Sin: All sins punished equally*

**Shell 3 - The Abandoned Sectors (Limbo)**
- Old shell sections, collapsed structures
- Refugees, outcasts, the mad
- Rumors of ancient technology
- *Sin: The Forgotten*

**Shell 2 - The Mist Border (Terror)**
- The lowest inhabitable shell
- Military outposts fighting constant incursions
- Where the Mist touches the shells
- Explorers and scavengers venture into The Old World below
- *Sin: Facing truth*

**Shell 1 - The Deep (The Surface/Hell)**
- The original surface world, consumed by Mist
- Ruins of our civilization buried in fog
- Unspeakable horrors lurk here
- Ancient secrets and technology await the brave
- *Sin: All of humanity's accumulated sins*

## The Core Mystery

At the center of the shells lies **The Core**—a massive power source that keeps the shells running. No one knows its true nature:
- Is it the planet's heart?
- An ancient machine built before the apocalypse?
- Something awakening from eons of slumber?

Recent tremors suggest The Core is failing... or waking up.

## Time's Passage

**The Great Unknown**: No one knows how long humanity has lived in the shells.
- Ancient texts suggest "The Before Times" but specifics are lost
- Technology has been rediscovered, reimagined, mixed with magic
- Some scholars say 10,000 years, others claim millions
- The truth is buried in The Deep, in the ruins of the old world

## The Current Crisis

1. **The Mist is Rising** - Reaching higher shells than ever before
2. **The Core Pulses** - Power fluctuations, strange dreams
3. **Ancient Things Stir** - In The Deep, something massive moves
4. **Shell Society Fractures** - Upper shells hoard resources as lower shells starve
5. **The Prophecy** - Old texts speak of "The Descent"—a hero must journey through all nine shells to The Core to prevent total collapse

## Gameplay Integration

- **Vertical Progression**: Journey down through shells (both physically and morally)
- **Shell-Specific Content**: Each shell has unique aesthetics, cultures, enemies
- **Moral Choices**: Help upper shells maintain order or side with lower shell rebellion?
- **Ancient Technology**: Scavenge old world tech in The Deep
- **The Mist**: Dynamic threat that can surge upward during events
- **Airships**: Navigate between shells, explore ruins jutting from Mist
- **Core Secrets**: Discover what really happened and what humanity has become

## Themes

- **Cyclical Destruction**: Will humanity repeat the mistakes that caused the apocalypse?
- **Class Warfare**: The shells literally embody social stratification
- **Forgotten History**: The danger of losing our past
- **Redemption**: Can humanity be saved, or should the shells fall?
- **What Lies Beneath**: Both literally (The Mist/Deep) and metaphorically (human nature)
